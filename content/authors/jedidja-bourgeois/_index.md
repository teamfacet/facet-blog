## Jedidja Bourgeois

Jedidja (Jedi) is a hands-on Platform Architect and member of the Facet Developer Network. He has over 20 years of professional development experience, approximately half of which were spent at Microsoft. In recent years, much of his focus has been on refactoring and moving existing projects towards testability.

Outside of development, Jedi spends a decent amount of time in the kitchen, trying to find the “perfect” version of one dish or another. Occasionally, he also remembers to get outside and exercise. He’s an avid reader and takes full advantage of the library’s request / ordering services.
