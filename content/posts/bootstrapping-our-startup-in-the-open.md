Starting today I'm going to be sharing publicly our company financial information, metrics, goals and strategies. Want to know how much money Facet is making? We're going to start publishing it. I'm super nervous about it, but I hope by doing this we can provide a live case study for people that want to bootstrap their own company.

## Why are we doing this?

Before starting my first company, I spent 10 years as a software engineer at Microsoft and Netflix. I wanted to become an entrepreneur, but I didn't know anything about business. At first I felt like I needed to find a "business" co-founder, but after six months of searching, I gave up. I decided that I was going to be the business guy and just figure things out as I went. It was very scary and I've felt completely out of my comfort zone ever since.

Since leaving Netflix in 2012, I've started two reasonably successful businesses - first Facet, which I bootstrapped, and second, Numetric, for which I raised $16M in VC funding. Along the way I've learned from countless painful mistakes. I think my learnings would be helpful for other software engineers that want to start a company some day. **On this blog you'll find help, advice and educational content specifically designed for software engineers that want to become founders of their own company.**

An essential component to learning how to start and run a company is to understand the basics of business finance and operations. By sharing our company financials, operational metrics and business strategy, you'll get an inside look into how an early stage company works. As we share the intimate details of our company I will include detailed explanations of what the different business concepts mean. My hope is that by reading this blog you will be better prepared when you decide to go from dev to founder.

I'm also doing this as part of our content marketing strategy for Facet. Content marketing is a way to market to potential customers indirectly. Rather than showing a potential customer an advertisement about your company, you provide them with valuable content like tutorials, guides, videos, podcasts, etc. Ever search for [how to install Postgres on Ubuntu](https://www.google.com/search?q=install+postgres+ubuntu&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS810US812&oq=install+postgres+ubu&aqs=chrome.0.0l2j69i57j0l3.2787j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)? You'll likely end up on digitalocean.com. DigitalOcean doesn't sell Postgres or Ubuntu per se, but they do sell a product that is used by the type of person that would need help installing Postgres on Ubuntu. They provide their target customer with a useful tutorial and in return, they get:

1. **Brand awareness**: Potential customers learn that there is a company out there called DigitalOcean that sells VPCs and other cloud services.
2. **Credibility**: Their tutorials are awesome and it shows that they are experts in the field.
3. **Trust**: When the tutorials work it builds trust in their company.
4. **Customer love**: They are helping you for free, which is really nice and creates customers that feel appreciation for them.

Content marketing, if done right, can be a very inexpensive way to acquire customers. You pay the cost to write the tutorial once, and people are viewing it for years to come. DigitalOcean has one of the best content marketing programs I've ever seen.

At Facet, part of our target customer base are software engineers that are aspiring entrepreneurs. By producing content that might help a software engineer on their journey to becoming a founder, we hope that some of them will join the Facet Developer Network.

Lastly, I think transparency is good for this type of business. Being open with our contractors and customers about what our markup is builds trust in Facet and ensures that we are providing enough value that our customers feel like we are worth it.

Ok, here we go.

## The journey so far

A friend and I started Facet (originally called Attack Pattern) back in 2011 as a contract software development shop. We were both working full-time for Netflix and decided to start a company together. We spent the first year trying to make sales on the side and, eventually, it worked! We landed our first customer in late 2012; a $450,000 project for Western Digital, the storage giant. We felt like we could complete the project in 3 months time, which left us with plenty of runway to find our next project.

By using this strategy, we were able to start a company with almost no risk. We both knew that, in the worst case scenario, if we weren't able to find our next customer in 12 months time, we could both go back to work at some BigCo.

Fortunately, we were able to find another customer, and then another, and then another. The company grew fairly quickly during the first four years. We eventually hired additional full-time developers to help us do the work we were bringing in.

### Our Revenue

Revenue is the money a company earns by providing goods or services. We earned our revenue by providing software development services to other companies.

![Facet Gross Margin as of 2018](/blog/uploads/facet-revenue-2018.jpg)

The first four years were really good! We grew almost 4x in our second year, then 50% in years three and four. Hitting $1M in revenue was an incredible feeling! Here we had bootstrapped a company from nothing into a **real** business with **real** customers. There were plenty of ups and downs along the way, and I think I always felt like it could all disappear at any moment, but I was quite proud that I, a programmer, built a real business.

In early 2105, I started splitting my time between Facet and a new startup I was working on, Numetric. I hired a CEO to take over the daily operations of Facet and I began to focus completely on Numetric. As startups do, Numetric took over my life and I ended up neglecting Facet. At first I thought it was cool that I had a company that I owned that didn't require any work! This was a mistake. I should have held regular board meetings, asked for regular reports, and monitored the health of the company. As you can see, when I stopped working on my company, it stopped growing.

In late 2018 I decided to come back to Facet full-time as the CEO to see if I could grow the business. I decided to pivot the company into a different business model, so in many ways, we are a new startup. More on that later.

### Our Gross Profit

Gross Profit = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold. If your company sold cookies, your Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) would be the cost of the ingredients, the labor cost to make the cookies, packaging and delivery costs. If you are a SaaS company, your hosting fees and customer support would be your COGS. Facet provides contract software development services, so our COGS are the salaries or sub-contractor payments we pay to the people that do the work for our customers.

![Facet Gross Profit as of 2018](/blog/uploads/facet-gross-profit-2018.jpg)

Because my co-founder and I were doing most of the work in 2013 and 2014, and we didn't count our salaries in COGS (though we probably should have), our GP was REALLY high. Your GP tells you how much money you have to operate and grow your business. You use your gross profits to pay for your office space, fly to visit potential customers or hire sales people.

### Our Gross Margin

Gross Margin = Gross Profit/Revenue. Gross Margin (GM) is the percentage of your revenue that is Gross Profit. A grocery store will have a GM of around 20%. Ford has a GM of around 15-20%. Most software companies have a GM of around 80-90%. The reason software has such a high GM compared to other types of businesses is because to sell another car, Ford has to pay for the cost to build the car, whereas the cost of selling another copy of Jira or GitHub is close to $0. Other businesses with great GM: energy drinks, makeup, and pharmaceuticals.

In general, the higher your GM the better. However, many businesses are quite successful, even with a low GM.

![Facet Gross Margin as of 2018](/blog/uploads/facet-gross-margin-2018.jpg)

With our new business model, we will make a fixed 20% margin on our billings. We are more like a marketplace that charges a transaction or service fee. Currently, we plan to report all our billings as revenue since the money flows through Facet. That means our margins will look small, but whatever.

### Our Net Income

Net Income = Revenues - Expenses. Net Income is the profit your company is making. It's what's left over after all the expenses of operating your business. Net Income can also be expressed as (Revenue - COGS) - Operational Expenses. For example, rent for your office space, non-COGS salaries, travel expenses, marketing, office snacks, computers, etc. As a business owner, net income is probably your most important metric.

![Facet Net Income as of 2018](/blog/uploads/facet-net-income-2018.jpg)

This is where it gets ugly. After leaving Facet to focus on my new startup, our profits took a nosedive. We've lost money for the past three years in a row. When your business is losing money, that means you don't get paid. :-( It also means you need to find a way to put cash back into your business or you will run out of money and have to close down. That means drawing on your personal savings, taking out bank loans, or some other source of funding.

2015 through 2017 were very hard years in my life. I was trying to get a new startup off the ground and, every time I saw my CEO at Facet calling, I was afraid to pick up the phone. It seemed like he always had bad news. My company seemed to be falling apart and there was nothing I could do about it. I had 40 employees at Numetric that were counting on me, plus my friends, family and VCs who had invested in Numetric.

I had invested most of my personal savings into Numetric too. I had to take out a line of credit on my house to keep Facet alive. Our finances were under heavy strain, which in turn caused strain on my wife and kids.

Fortunately, in 2018 I was fired from Numetric. :-) I returned to Facet mid-2018 and in November I decided to take back over as CEO. I have a new vision for Facet that I am really excited about and that I hope will allow us to scale the company. My goal is to take everything I've learned over the past 8 years and use it to grow Facet to something much bigger. I also plan to continue to bootstrap Facet. I strongly prefer building and running a bootstrapped company that produces profit, over a VC backed company that is constantly losing money. You could say I have a bit of a chip on my shoulder.

## The pivot

Before starting Facet I worked at Microsoft and Netflix for 9 years. I didn't like working at a big company, but the salary and benefits were too good to pass up. I always felt like I would enjoy freelance/contract work more, but I didn't want to take on the hassle of finding work and chasing down payments. While an engineering manager at Microsoft, I sometimes needed contract engineers, but the quality was not good.

Then a few months ago I had an idea - could we build a company that designed to solve those two problems? Facet would build a sales and marketing team to find high-quality contract work. Then we build a network of high-quality contractors to sub out the work to. If you are an independent contractor, we serve as your sales team, your collections team, your legal team, etc. If you are an engineering manager, you can use Facet to browse a curated network of talent - no more recruiters, no more piles of bad resumes.

There are other platforms out there that offer a similar service, like Upwork or Guru, but customers don't shop there for senior software developers that were like me. We made Facet a premium service.  Said another way, Facet is a marketplace for hiring premium quality software talent located in the US or Canada. Contractors that join Facet to work set their own hourly rate. Facet clients that hire contractors through Facet pay a 20% markup on the hourly rate for the convenience of working with a single company and for us doing the work of sourcing and screening the talent.

## Early signs look very promising

The pivot is a pretty big departure from what we were doing before, so in a lot of ways we are a brand new startup. We had 0 contractors in our network in September 2018. We now have 80. We had 0 customers for our new business model in September 2018, we now have a dozen or so. Some were existing customers we transitioned over, but most are new customers since September 2018.

In October 2018 I made a comment on Hacker News about our new business model with a link to [my first blog post announcing the Facet Developer Network](/blog/posts/the-facet-developer-network-the-freelancer-network-for-former-faangetc-engineers/). That comment and blog post drove 700 visitors to our website and 60 applications to the Facet Developer Network. That's an 8.6% conversion rate! That's extremely high. 45 of the applications met our high quality bar and were accepted. That was all the confirmation I needed that we were on to something.

Since then we've been putting the systems and processes in place to support our new scalable business model. We've also started building our actual product. We're not ready to onboard hundreds of contractors or dozens of customers yet. We only need a few new customers and a dozen or so new contractors this year to grow the company by 3x!

## Next Up

In my next post I will go deeper into our plans and goals for 2019, as well as the specific strategies and tactics we'll be testing. In other words, I'll share how we plan on executing on our idea. I'll also share our key metrics for the months since we pivoted and what a good growth rate is.
