I was riding up the elevator in the Grand American Hotel in Salt Lake City when I had a premonition - "What if the board is waiting for me in the hotel room and they've come to fire me?" My heart skipped a beat and I had a brief moment of panic. 

Moments of self doubt and panic happen all the time when you are a founder. Thoughts like “What if they haven’t wired the money yet because they changed their minds?” or “Maybe they are late on their first day of work because they decided not to accept the job offer.” were common for me. I would always dismiss them as just paranoia. 

I tried to dismiss this one too. 

"We are just meeting to go over this year’s executive compensation plan, just like he said we were...in a hotel room...for a surprise in person meeting…by our VC partner that is based in New York...a week after our last board meeting that went really bad…”

I couldn’t shake this one.

## My Startup Obsession

Seven months earlier, after three years of blood, sweat and tears, we had finally closed our Series A round of funding - $13M from top-tier VCs. The fact that we closed our series A round was a miracle. I hope to be able to share that story some day, but for now, all I can say is that it felt good to fire the employee that tried to sabotage the deal. He will forever be known at Numetric as the Rat Faced Bastard.

The day the money was supposed to arrive, I called my executive team into our janky conference room. It was furnished with Ikea’s finest. I pulled up our bank account on the TV screen and hit refresh every so often while we reminisced about the crazy ride that had gotten us here. 

Suddenly, $2M dollars showed up in the bank account. Holy crap, it actually happened. Then $3M more showed up. Then $500K. Then $1.5M. Over the next couple of hours our company bank account grew to something north of $13M. I’d never seen so much money before. Someone made the customary joke about running off to Mexico with the money.

Numetric had been a grind since the beginning. It felt like we had more than our fair share of setbacks, but we never gave up. For several years I took no salary and worked extreme hours. I might have only spent 80 hours a week in the office, but I never unplugged from work. I had taken money from angel investors - some of them friends and family - and it would be my fault if I lost it. I couldn’t let that happen. Every minute I wasn’t working I felt guilty.

When I wasn't working, my thoughts were completely consumed by my startup. Like many founders, I sacrificed time with my wife and kids, family relationships, friendships, hobbies and even my health. Pretty much every other source of happiness and fulfillment were gone from my life. My employees had become my family.

I would tell myself that I was sacrificing time with my family now, so that I could spend much more time with them in the future. Once I sold the company, I could retire and I would have unlimited time for my family. That never happened.

I invested so much of my life into the company, my startup had become an integral part of my identity. I gave up everything for my startup. 

## The Firing

When the elevator doors opened, I could see the overcast sky and snow-covered mountains outside - it was beautiful. I walked down the hall, took a deep breath and knocked on the door. The board member I was supposed to meet opened the door. Then I saw another board member sitting in the hotel room and I knew. It felt like I had been punched in the stomach. My heart started pounding, hands started sweating and my mind started racing. Even now, over a year later, it still feels so fresh. It’s hard to write about it.

At that point I knew the decision had been made and there wasn't any point in putting up a fight. I just wanted to negotiate the best severance I could. It was really hard to focus though. All I could think was that this couldn't be real. I was angry. So very angry. I had sacrificed so much for this company. It was MY company. I made it. My idea, my invention, my product design, my brand, my vision. 

Two weeks ago, I was having an intimate dinner with these same people. We were friends bonding over the struggle of building a startup. Now they were completely cold.

When I sat down, they handed me an envelope with my severance agreement. I asked why the board had decided to fire me. They wouldn’t answer. Now all business, they didn’t want to risk exposing themselves to potential lawsuits by saying the wrong thing.

I kept saying “Guys, it’s me.” Any connection or friendship we may have shared was gone now. I don’t think it had ever been real. VCs are not your friend.

I asked if I could help with the search for a replacement CEO. They said they already had one. The COO I hired two months ago was going to be the new CEO. Damn, they set me up.

## The Setup

A few weeks after closing our series A, our new VC began pressuring me to hire a COO. We were way too small to need a COO. So, I asked them point blank, “Are you trying to get me to hire a COO so you can get rid of me?” They vehemently denied it and acted hurt that I would even suggest such a thing, after all that we had been through together. I felt bad and even apologized.

Our VC was heavily involved in the recruiting process for the COO. They interviewed all of the candidates that made it through the screening process. We hired their first choice.

After his first week on the job, I called my new COO into my office. I needed his help. We were making a lot of sales, but we were having a hard time delivering the solutions we promised our customers. I felt like we needed to focus on a specific market niche and I wanted to work together to figure out a plan. His days were full of meetings getting up to speed so, I asked him to stay after hours with me a few nights that week so we could strategize together.

“No. I’m done working the long hours, I did that already at my last company. **I’m not going to be your little bitch, Robert.**” What? Who says that to their boss on their first week on the job? I had no idea how to respond to that.

Over the next few weeks I had my assistant set up meetings during work hours. He wouldn’t show up. 

What are you supposed to do when the COO you just hired acts this way? There is no playbook for this in the CEO manual. I decided that these were just personality quirks and I would just have to work around it. What else could I do?

## My Last Day

Back in the hotel room at the Grand American, suddenly all the pieces came together - being forced to hire a COO, being forced to give him a board seat, the insubordination from the new COO. I was pissed. “I knew it! I knew you were trying to replace me.” 

He just rolled his eyes.

So it was over. It was the first time I had ever been fired, and it was my own damn company. I was devastated. 

I didn’t sleep at all that night. The next day I stood in front of the company and told them that I was being fired for poor performance. I wanted to own the fact that I got fired and not pretend like I was “leaving to pursue other opportunities.”

I walked out of the building and have not been back since. 

I held the majority of the common shares at the company, which gave me control over two board seats. However, I was forced to give up my board seat control or they wouldn’t give me any severance. I had put my entire life-savings into the company, without severance we would lose our home. I had to consent. 

After giving up voting control of my board seats, they offered me a seat on the board. I considered it at first. Why would I want to continue working with these people? Why would I want to put myself in a position to be fired a second time? I knew I wouldn’t be able to start the healing process until this chapter of my life was closed. I declined.

## Healing

I spent the next couple of months holed up in my basement, desperate to find my next startup idea. I was trying to fill the void in my life and regain my identity as a startup founder. I wanted to prove that they had made a mistake by building a bigger and better company. When they came begging to invest, I would tell them to get lost.

I had to throw away all the Numetric t-shirts, water bottles and other swag I had accumulated over the years. It hurt too much to look at them. I even bought a new laptop so that I didn’t have to use the laptop I had used while building Numetric. Even driving past the old offices was painful, so I would avoid that part of town completely. I erased everything Numetric in my life.

I started listening to [How I built this](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this), the NPR podcast about how founders built their companies. I found that I wasn’t alone. Reed Hoffman had been fired from his startup before going on to start LinkedIn. David Neeleman, the founder of JetBlue, was unceremoniously fired and can’t look at the JetBlue signs in the airport anymore. It helped a lot.

Slowly the urgency of proving “them” wrong started to fade. I gave myself permission to take some time off. I took a three month sabbatical to rethink my life.

Building a venture backed startup had been a dream of mine for years. I always felt a pang of jealousy when I would see the fundraising announcements of other startups on Hacker News. I remember sitting in the Andreessen Horowitz offices before my pitch and realizing I was living my dream.  Now I’d done it and...meh. 

My startup journey ended sooner than I had planned, but looking back on the experience, it kinda sucked. The glitz and glamour of startup life is an illusion. All you see is the polished press releases or carefully disguised VC propaganda. It’s a lot like the picture perfect lives you see on Instagram. My startup had sucked everything it could out of me, and when it was done, it spit me out.

I started spending time with my wife and family again. We traveled to beautiful places. I lost some weight and discovered a passion for mountain biking. I stopped thinking about startups and venture capital.

## Where to go from here?

After my sabbatical, I started thinking about what I would do next. I had been at Netflix when the share price had fallen below $10 (adjusted for splits). It was now at over $300. Many of my former coworkers at Netflix had become millionaires since I left to go chase my startup dream. If I had stayed, I would have been in a much better position financially. I could always go back, but that felt like admitting defeat. The thought of having a manager and playing corporate politics again felt gross. 

As a second time founder, it would be much easier to raise funding this time around, so I had that going for me. Before Numetric, I had [bootstrapped Facet to a multi-million dollar company](https://www.facetdev.com/blog/posts/my-roundabout-journey-bootstrapping-to-15m-in-lifetime-revenue/). I decided to leave that behind to go do a “real startup.”  Looking back I realized that building a profitable company was the most fun and rewarding time of my entire career. So I decided to abandon the idea of raising venture capital, including [turning down the opportunity to interview for the Y Combinator S2018 batch](https://www.facetdev.com/blog/posts/why-i-turned-down-my-y-combinator-interview/).

My new goal is to just get on base. Get an exit under my belt while having fun and retaining control. I don’t need a grand-slam for my first exit and I’m not willing to give up my life for a slim chance at a unicorn exit.

I came back to Facet to solve a problem for developers that I had experience first hand: transitioning to freelance is hard. There wasn’t an Upwork for ex-Netflix type engineers. So that’s what we are building and [things are going really well](https://www.facetdev.com/blog/posts/facet-q1-2019-financials-and-progress-report/).

It has taken over a year, but thinking about Numetric is no longer painful. I am at peace with it. Last week my wife leaned over to me while were settling in for bed - I had wrapped up work at 6pm like I normally do now - and she said “I’m just so happy right now. Life is good.” 

Life *is* good. Being fired from my startup is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.

## Advice For VCs

Before going the hostile route, you should start by trying to work with the founder on a transition plan. Treating the founder with gratitude and respect will work much better for you. In my case, blindsiding me and backing me into a corner cost the company a lot more in severance to me.

The truth is, I was MISERABLE towards the end of my time at Numetric. A month before being fired, I confessed to my wife that I was planning on resigning. If the board had asked me to, I would have gladly accepted. Because they treated me like an adversary, I asked for a lot more. Jokes on them.

## Advice For Founders

Retain control of your company. The best way to do that is to only raise money if you don’t need it. What does that mean? It means you have to build a real business that generates actual revenue and maybe even a profit. If you are burning large amounts of money each month, then you are not in control of your company. Venture capital will only make it worse for you.

Ignore conventional startup wisdom. It’s not designed to make you successful. It is designed to produce a low win rate and you need a high success rate. Focus on profit and growth - not revenue and growth. Service revenue is awesome. 

Get creative about how to generate cash. Provide services or pick up consulting work on the side. (BTW, [we can help you with that](https://www.facetdev.com/work).)

Convincing a VC to give you money does not validate your business model. It just means that you are good at pitching.

The company party you have after you close a round of funding will be a huge let down.

Bootstrap. It’s awesome.
